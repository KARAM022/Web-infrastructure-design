# Web Infrastructure Design

## Introduction

This repository contains a presentation on web infrastructure design, demonstrating the evolution from a simple single-server setup to a more complex and secured distributed system. The presentation aims to provide an understanding of how different components in a web infrastructure interact and how to address common issues related to scalability, security, and fault tolerance.

The presentation covers the following key areas:

- **Simple Web Stack**: Introduction to a basic single-server web infrastructure.
- **Distributed Web Infrastructure**: Enhancement of the basic setup with multiple servers and load balancing.
- **Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure**: Incorporating security measures and monitoring to ensure reliability and protection against threats.
- **Scale Up Infrastructure**: Strategies for scaling up the infrastructure to handle increased traffic and demand.

Each section outlines the components involved, their roles, and the benefits and challenges associated with each setup. This structured approach helps in understanding the trade-offs and considerations when designing a web infrastructure.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this presentation are:

1. **Understand the Basics**: Learn the fundamental components of a web infrastructure and their interactions.
2. **Identify Common Issues**: Recognize common problems such as single points of failure, downtime, and scalability challenges.
3. **Implement Security Measures**: Understand the importance of security measures like SSL, firewalls, and monitoring.
4. **Scalability Strategies**: Explore strategies to scale the infrastructure effectively to meet growing demands.

By the end of this presentation, you should have a comprehensive understanding of web infrastructure design and be able to apply these concepts to create robust, scalable, and secure web systems.
